**Visibility principle - monitor cloud spend**  
  Cloud cost management should aim to extend the visibility of the cost spend and its significance to all the stakeholders in the organization that are using it. The more cost aware stakeholders are in the organization the easier it will be to identify early in the process any cost variations and apply the right corrective actions to mitigate them and/or prevent them to occur again. Extending visibility is also a fundamental step towards our principle of accountability which is discussed more in detail in the next principle. Visibility and cost awareness could only be achieved if the cloud spending should focus on the following: 

  - Track usage and cost trends 
  - Detect spending anomalies and usage inefficiencies 
  - Forecast future spend based on historical data 
  - Visualize data in consolidated or custom dashboards 

Azure Cost Management provides a predefined series of dashboards and reports, as well as, the ability to create and personalize any of them to meet your organizational requirements.

## Guidance
Use the following information when considering how to implement showback and chargeback.

1. **Identify your cloud expenses - visibility**  
For enterprise cloud deployments, a cloud bill can be represented by monthly line items in the magnitude of billions. Usage-based costing will delve into the maximum level of detail. A good starting point is identifying and focusing on your main cost contributors. Most of the time sudden spikes in cost are due to a few departments or individuals that are unaware of the governance and policies around your cloud environment 

    Make all cloud spending visible to the organization and set clear budgets for each of your cloud spending categories. A good starting point is setting budgets for your departments and account owners first. As part of an iteration process you can broaden the scope of budget setting up to the resource group level.  

2. **Accountability principle - drive organizational accountability**:   
As mentioned in principle number one, providing high degrees of visibility is a fundamental step to increase the cost awareness of the organization. Once visibility is a mature capability in your cost management activities, the next step is to make stakeholders directly accountable to their cloud spending and highlight the overall impact to the organization. To drive accountability in the organization, the cloud spending should focus on the following: 

   - Allocate usage and costs to business units and projects 
   - Produce chargeback and showback reports 
   - Let teams access data and insights with Role-based Access Control (RBAC) 
   - Automatically alert stakeholders of spending anomalies and risks 

3. **Efficiency principle - optimize cloud efficiency**:   
Make reference to the Usage Optimization Page here 

   - Increase resource utilization with workload right-sizing 
   - Eliminate Idle resources 
   - Improved the management of reserved resources. e.g., Reserved virtual machines, etc.  

    Cloud optimization is not a one-time effort. Due to the constant evolution and rate of change in the cloud platform itself and in the organization. Consider establishing a "Continuous Optimization" Cloud practice that focuses on monitoring all changes that surround the cloud ecosystem, review and implement changes targeting resource and cost optimization. 

    For an effective definition and maintenance of your continuous optimization practice, we recommended that, on a regular basis, facilitate the following conversations: 

4. **Which cloud resource type will a technical resource (eg. DevOps) naturally choose?** 
  From the technical perspective, the cloud resource selection is based on the combination of functional and non-functional requirements. However, we can still meet this requirements on an on-demand basis   
  
  Remember that previous infrastructure models where design to choose resource for "Peak times" rather than usage-based consumption. This might trigger the selection of suboptimal resources for an application 

5. **Which will deliver more success to the business?** 
  By detaching ourselves from the non-functional (i.e., technical) aspects of the solution, we will realize that cloud resources can meet the business requirements at the same level (i.e., right-sizing instead of oversizing)   
  
    This is also a direct feedback loop to development and operations teams on how a specific business functionality should be designed and deployed. By adoption modern frameworks such as DevOps, Agile and Continuous delivery we can make the cloud economies of scale work in favour of our optimization efforts and not the opposite 

6. **Which one will make managers and finance want do more things in the cloud?** 
  As financial metrics, such as Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Return of Investment (ROI), are continuously ensuring the best business case for Cloud, the business and finance teams will feel encouraged to move more systems in to the cloud platform. Leverage this opportunity to expand your cloud scope.    
  
    It is important for all teams to understand how their cloud resource decisions can completely overshadow the business benefits of cloud and discouraging adoption from the business. A healthy balance of policy, cost and optimization management will help address this challenge
