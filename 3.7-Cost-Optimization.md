# Cost Optimization
Use the information described in this section to assist when defining your cost optimization strategy.
<br />
<br />

Cost optimization is not a one-time effort; it is an evolving process. Your organization must regularly and systematically review its deployed Azure resources for cost efficiency. 

The core principles to optimizing cost efficiency are:

- **Increase resource utilization with virtual machine right-sizing**: Ensure that your virtual machines are of the correct size prior to deploying to Azure. 
   
- **Eliminate idle resources**: Determine optimal VM usage and identify idle VMs or remove idle VMs and unattached disks with Cost Management.
- **Optimize reserved instances**: Optimize your reserved instance (RI) costs and utilization for Azure by tracking usage, assessing impact and allocating RI costs (according to your policies). You can also analyze the costs associated with pricing models.

## Guidance
Use the following to implement a cost optmization strategy:

- When designing your infrastructure and assembling the specifications for your VMs, determine an initial baseline. Regularly monitor and rightsize your virtual machines as your utilization grows. 

- Implement a governance model or policy standard for your key stakeholders. Enforce the standards to prevent orphaned Azure resources and overprovisioning of unnecessary Azure resources.

- Consider using Azure managed PaaS services such as [Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-technical-overview), [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes) (i.e. container service) to optimize value and costs for systems that require database and container services. 

- If you have backup snapshots enabled for blob and disk storage through Azure recovery vault, closely monitor and [delete aged snapshots](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-manage-vms#delete-backup-data).

- [Delete unattached disk storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/find-unattached-disks) to ensure that unused disk storages for terminated virtual machines do not accrue unneccessary costs. 

- Consider [shutting down and starting virtual machines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-solution-vm-management) during non-peak business hours or for environments such as QA and Development. This duty cycle helps to ensure you don't accrue unnecessary runtime costs for unused virtual machines.

- [Prepay for virtual machines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/prepay-reserved-vm-instances) and save money with [reserved instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/reserved-vm-instances/).
