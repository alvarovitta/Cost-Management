# Designing your Azure Subscription for Cost Management
Use the procedure described in this section to design a subscription. 
<br />
<br />

When designing the subscription model, consider that your organization's subscription enrollment is likely to expand and grow more 
complex over time. Your subscription enrollment strategy should be scalable and adaptive.

Consider the following Subscription patterns as a template in designing your subscription model:   

- **[Sandbox Pattern](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/2.1.1-Using-the-Sandbox-Pattern.md):** Use when learning how to use Azure and build subscriptions.    

- **[Sandbox +  Production](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/2.1.2-Using-the-Sandbox-and-Production-Pattern.md):** Use to create a separate subscription to deploy production workloads.  
- **[Sandbox + Production + Purpose Built](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/2.1.3-Using-the-Sandbox-and-Production-and-Purpose-Built-Pattern.md):**  Use for organizations that require a separate, production-ready subscription for running 
workloads.  
- **[Continuous Development Lifecycle](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/2.1.4-Using-the-Continuous-Development-Lifecycle-Pattern.md):** Use to maintain isolated sandbox subscription and production workloads.
<br />
<br />

## Guidance  
Use the following to assist you when designing your description:
- Plan for multiple subscriptions  

- Start with one subscription; try to minimize the number of subscriptions; add additional subscriptions based on requirements  
- Minimize the number of subscription owners  
- Refrain from assigning one account owner across multiple subscription types  
- Use Azure Active Directory for Azure Governance roles  
- Use Built-In Roles before Custom Roles  
- Create Custom RBAC Roles only if Built-in does not exist  
- Use groups to assign RBAC versus users  
- Take network requirements and ExpressRoute boundaries into account  
<br />  

**For multiple Azure subscriptions**:
Consider and plan for the following  

- Duplicate provisioning and management: IP Address space, network circuits, gateways, vNets, Subnets, NSGs, routing

- More connectivity to manage   
- More security to manage  
- More identities to manage  
- Potentially more ExpressRoute (ER) circuits to buy  
- Review the following: [Azure enterprise scaffold - prescriptive subscription governance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/cloud-adoption-guide/subscription-governance)   
- Take subscription limits under consideration when planning for subscription designs. See subscription limits at: [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits)
<br />
<br />
  
## Preparation  
Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks:  

1. Consult the following stakeholders as part of the subscription definition:   

   a. **Service Owners:**  Own the subscriptions

   b. **IT Operations owners:**  Owns the customer policies and procedures related to IT Service Management and continuity of 
operations   

   c. **Workload and Application owners:**  Owns the business requirements and driver of consumption of the different cloud 
services  

2. Collect the subscriber details as outlined in the following table:   

    | Field        | Value           |  
    | ------------- |-------------|
    |Subscription Name | \<Subscription_Name\> |
    |Pattern | [Sandbox](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/2.1.1-Using-the-Sandbox-Pattern.md), [Production](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/2.1.2-Using-the-Sandbox-and-Production-Pattern.md), [Purpose Built](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/2.1.3-Using-the-Sandbox-and-Production-and-Purpose-Built-Pattern.md) |
    |Account | \<Parent_Account\> |
    |Department | \<Parent_Department\> |
    |Service Administrator Azure AD Credentials | \<service.admin@tenant.onmicrosoft.com\> |
    |Service Administrator Email |\<___@tenant.onmicrosoft.com\> |
    |Subscription Type |\<Microsoft Azure Enterprise, Dev/Test\> *|
 
   \* Enterprises can identify an account and a subscription to host DevTest Workloads at a discounted rate. 
<br />
<br />

## Procedure: How to design a subscription  
Use this procedure to design a subscription.  

1. **Define the subscription structure**  
  Refer to the following subscription patterns:   

   - [Using the Sandbox Pattern](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/2.1.1-Using-the-Sandbox-Pattern.md)  

   - [Using the Sandbox + Production Pattern](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/2.1.2-Using-the-Sandbox-and-Production-Pattern.md)   

   - [Using the Sandbox + Production + Purpose Built Pattern](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/2.1.3-Using-the-Sandbox-and-Production-and-Purpose-Built-Pattern.md)  

   - [Using the Continuous Development Lifecycle Pattern](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/2.1.4-Using-the-Continuous-Development-Lifecycle-Pattern.md)  

   See Subscription Setup Methodology, see: [Onboarding Guide to the Microsoft Azure Enterprise Portal](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/_images/azuredirecteacustomeronboardingguide_en.pdf), pg. 23. 


2. **Create the subscription and assign a Service Administrator**  
  Access the [Account Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/?v=18.20) and follow the steps described in: [Assigning the Service Administrator Role](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/1.4-Assigning-the-Service-Administrator-Role.md). 

4. **Designate an RBAC owner**   
  Add an RBAC Owner administrator for a subscription in Azure portal, see: [Manage Administrator Roles - Add an RBAC Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator#add-an-rbac-owner-admin-for-a-subscription-in-azure-portal)  

5. **Add or change a co-administrator**   
Using the Azure portal, designate a co-administrator, see:  [Manage Administrator Roles - Add or Change Co-Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator#add-or-change-co-administrator)  

6. **Change the Service Administrator for an Azure subscription**   
  See: [Manage Administrator Roles - Change the Service Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator#change-the-service-administrator-for-an-azure-subscription)  

7. **Change the Account Administrator for an Azure subscription**   
  See: [Manage Administrator Roles - Change the Account Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator#change-the-service-administrator-for-an-azure-subscription).
