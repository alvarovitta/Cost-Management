# Implementing Metering and Billing
Use the information in this section to implement metering and billing for your Azure resources.
<br />
<br />

Since the enterprise started to rely on technology resources (from Mainframe to Datacentres) to execute work, the need to measure and cost these resources has been fundamental. However, as the technology has evolved through time the measurement and costing have been experiencing change in a very significant way. In some instances metering and costing becomes a simpler exercise while in other complexity can become increasingly higher than what we use to.  

With Cloud computing as the latest chapter in the management of technology resources, change was meant to happen. Despite this expected change, the fundamentals of measure and cost have been constant through time: 
 
  1. **Resource definition** - Outline the list of resources that you will be providing or provisioning to your organization 
  2. **Pricing structure** - Define how you will cost each one of the resources defined 
  3. **Timeline view** - Ability to group the consumption of resources, and their associated cost, in time portions for visualization and decision making 

These three fundamental elements are still relevant to the present day. However, Cloud computing is changing and disrupting each one of these fundamentals by: 

  1. Enabling an increasing number of resources and also allow these resources to be grouped to define new types of logical resources (compounding the complexity of resource definition) 

  2. For each of the foundational and grouped resources mentioned above, there is a specific pricing model. On top of that, as the cloud scales pricing is constantly varying by different orders of magnitude 

  3. Ability to consume resources by smaller units of time. e.g., Some cloud resources are consumed and charge by the second. 

Considering all these changes brought by the Public Cloud Model, the use of our traditional tool and assumptions for metering and billing can't be applied without changing them as well or even in some cases discarding them and adopting new ones. The purpose of this section is to help you navigate through this changes and adapt your models, tools and frameworks to this new way of measuring and costing.

## Guidance
Use the following considerations when designing your metering and billing strategy.

**Define and group resources**:  
One important aspect to highlight is that all the changes that cloud computing brought to the metering and costing exercise of technology resources are detrimental to the management of technology. Quite the opposite. The ability to define and group resources at the physical and logical layer have enabled the well known "As a Service" model, or cloud platform options, in which you only pay for the specific consumption of a resource based on the value it provides to you without worrying about what happens in the back to make it work. 

The best example of this is Software as a Service (SaaS). Products like Office365, Dynamics365 or Power BI can be enabled with a simple technology resource setup. Measuring and costing are fairly simple as the model is abstracted to the highest level. e.g, Cost models like Users per month, subscriptions, etc. In some cases you focus your costing into one of the three fundamental elements: You only care how many users per month use a specific service, etc.  

In the SaaS model, the level of responsibility that you have in regards to the technology resource (or Service) is very low. As always there is trade-offs. If your level of responsibility is low, your flexibility around the way the service operates is low as well. Your main focus is the value you get. This adds another change in the way resources are metered and costed in a Public Cloud. The following table shows the levels of responsibility and balance that should exist in the three main Public Cloud Models:

<br />

**Perform an analysis - Multiple points of View**:  
The same way that the balance of control and responsibility changes across all the different cloud models, your perspective on how you address measurement and cost should change as well. The following table describes the perspective that you should take for each of the cloud platforms options available today: 

| __Cloud Model__ | __Metering and Costing Complexity Level__ |__Metering and Costing Resource Unit__ |__Minimum Time Unit__ |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Software as a Service (SaaS)    | Low | Organizational Unit (e.g., User, Group, etc.)  | Year and/or Month   | 
| Platform as a Service (PaaS)      | Medium | Logical Service (e.g., Data Service, Web Service, etc.)  | Day, Hour | 
| Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)      | High | Infrastructure Resource (e.g., Virtual Machine, Database, etc.)  | Minute, Second or lower | 
<br />
<br />

**The Role of metering and billing in the enterprise**:  
Resource metering and billing in the public cloud goes beyond a financial or an operational exercise. There are three main reasons why metering and billing are a critical component in the management of public cloud: 
<br />
<br />

1.  **Resource Infrastructure usage**:  
  You need to have a clear picture on how your organization is using the public cloud or how it is consumed. Once Azure is enabled in your organization, and in alignment with your access control, users will be capable of provisioning a cloud resource and start using it almost immediately. 
  
    On top of that resources can be provisioned but stay unused. With all these activity happening inside your Azure ecosystem it is important that you have, at all times, a clear picture of what is being used so you can have an educated discussion with user on why these resources are being deployed. 

2.  **Determine responsibility**:   
  In an environment that encourages agility it is important to know who in the organization is using public cloud resources. More importantly, how these model align to the organization governance framework in regards to authorizing the provisioning and deployment of resources.  
  
    In the on-premise world, enterprises have defined a series of governance, policies and controls to ensure that the right procurement process is followed. Please note that we are not recommending to just use the same decision and governance framework you currently to the public cloud environment. More than that, we would like you to have all the necessary tools and data points to adapt your process to ensure you get the right balance of agility, flexibility and control.  

 3. **Manage behaviours and expectations**:   
  While metering can be considered to be an operational exercise and billing, a financial consequence, both share one common characteristic: They are both a behavioural exercise as well. Metering and billing will leverage the same foundational data but show it to each user of the public cloud in way that matters to them. 
  
    In the presence of an uncontrolled public cloud ecosystem, developers and engineers could interpret this as the ability to deploy resources "a la carte".  This means that your application could be designed with the underlying assumption that resources are unlimited and priority will be given to other aspects of the development. Executive, Financial and/or Project teams need to have a view on the performance of the public cloud and what are the financial decisions that need to be made in order to get the most value out of these new cloud model. This is where billing, and later cost management, play an essential role in the cloud management and operations scope.
