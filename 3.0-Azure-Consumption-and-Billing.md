## Overview 

Managing Cloud spend in the Enterprise is becoming increasingly complex. Even with the right policies in place, a single department can increase the cloud spend exponentially with little to no value or no direct intention to do so. In contrast to other infrastructure models, Cloud costs are usage-based. As a result, Public Cloud Providers will ensure that the cloud bill contains the highest degree or level of detail that will justify the amount billed. Cost details could be reflected in reports that could contain millions or even billions of line items. Keep in mind that tracking is happening at the individual resource level which could mean: Virtual Machines, Storage, Network, etc. In addition, these resources are being provisioned across business units and projects throughout the organization. Your cloud cost or financial management could increase its complexity at the same or faster rate than your cloud environment. 


Billing is a fundamental pillar in a public cloud environment. Billing is the area that focuses on visualizing the consumption of infrastructure resources in monetary units.  The following picture/table shows the scope of billing and cost management in the context of public cloud: 

| __Measurement Objective__ | __Public Cloud Capability__ |__Description__ |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Cost Allocation  | Billing  | Snapshot of all the resources used in the Public Cloud | 
| Performance    | Cost Management | TCO, PNL, Business/Value case of using Public Cloud | 
| Financial Planning   | Optimization (Forecasting) | Budgeting and Decision making  | 
 

It is important to highlight that Public cloud billing is what will enable you to perform cost management and optimization of your public cloud environment. Billing and cost management are two separate topics of discussion from the cloud management perspective. This section will focus on the Consumption aspects of the public cloud. 



## Resource Provision versus Consumption 


One key consideration to have before we dive into public cloud billing is that there might be situations in which your infrastructure footprint (resource inventory) is different from the total amount of resource that are being consumed in the cloud. An example of this will be excess capacity and/or standby resources. In the context of public cloud these resources will be provisioned to your environment but will only show resource consumption until they are actually used. This is a fundamental change in the way you have manage the finances of your on-premise infrastructure. You will be billed for what you use and nothing more. The same will apply to resource that cloud users freeze at any given time. They might show up one month and not the next. Keep that in mind as this volatility sometimes creates confusion. 
 


## Design Considerations 


The Azure Cloud Cost Management capabilities have been designed with the following three core principles in mind: 

### Visibility Principle - Monitor Cloud Spend 

Cloud cost management should aim to extend the visibility of the cost spend and its significance to all the stakeholders in the organization that are using it. The more cost aware stakeholders are in the organization the easier it will be to identify early in the process any cost variations and apply the right corrective actions to mitigate them and/or prevent them to occur again. Extending visibility is also a fundamental step towards our principle of accountability which is discussed more in detail in the next principle. Visibility and cost awareness could only be achieved if the cloud spending should focus on the following: 

  - Track usage and cost trends 
  - Detect spending anomalies and usage inefficiencies 
  - Forecast future spend based on historical data 
  - Visualize data in consolidated or custom dashboards 


Azure Cost Management provides a predefined series of dashboards and reports, as well as, the ability to create and personalize any of them to meet your organizational requirements.  


## Proven Practices 


### Visibility 


   - For enterprise cloud deployments, a cloud bill can be represented by monthly line items in the magnitude of billions. Usage-based costing will delve into the maximum level of detail. A good starting point is identifying and focusing on your main cost contributors. Most of the time sudden spikes in cost are due to a few departments or individuals that are unaware of the governance and policies around your cloud environment 


   - Make all cloud spending visible to the organization and set clear budgets for each of your cloud spending categories. A good starting point is setting budgets for your departments and account owners first. As part of an iteration process you can broaden the scope of budget setting up to the resource group level.
