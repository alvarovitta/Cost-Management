## Overview 


Cloud optimization can be view from two different perspectives:  

  1. Usage optimization based on Resources 
  2. Cost optimization based on Cloud Spend 


The diagram below shows how these two optimization practices are part of the core areas in the Azure Cloud Cost Management framework:

### Resource Optimization 


The main focus of this optimization is to make sure that the organization is using cloud resources the right way. By focusing on the optimal resource usage we focus on identifying correct families & sizes of resources as well as correct resource/service types. Although this has a direct relationship with cost, the main driver behind a resource optimization targeted towards capacity, velocity and scale to achieve all planned business outcomes. 


It is important to highlight that Resource and Cost optimization don't compete with each other. Contrary to common belief, these two types of optimization complement each other. 


 
### Cost Optimization 

From the resourcing perspective, this optimization focuses on the acquisition of reserved resources and commitments of consumption in order to achieve cost savings.  


### Optimize Reserved instances 

The following tutorial will provide details on how to optimize your cloud spend by leveraging reserve instances:

### Azure Commitments 
 
If you have an Enterprise Agreement in place (EA) there are opportunities to commit Azure consumption at a discounted price. For more details on how Azure Commitment works, please reach out to your Microsoft Account Executive.   


 
## Design Considerations 

### Linkage to Cloud Cost Management 

The Azure Cloud Cost Management capabilities have been designed with the following three core principles in mind (which aligned with our core customer base feedback around cost management): 

### Efficiency Principle - Optimize Cloud Efficiency 

Make reference to the Usage Optimization Page here 

  - Increase resource utilization with workload right-sizing 
  - Eliminate Idle resources 
  - Improved the management of reserved resources. e.g., Reserved virtual machines, etc.  



## Proven Practices 


Cloud optimization is not a one-time effort. Due to the constant evolution and rate of change in the cloud platform itself and in the organization. Consider establishing a "Continuous Optimization" Cloud practice that focuses on monitoring all changes that surround the cloud ecosystem, review and implement changes targeting resource and cost optimization. 

For an effective definition and maintenance of your continuous optimization practice, we recommended that, on a regular basis, facilitate the following conversations: 

  **1. Which cloud resource type will a technical resource (e.g., DevOps) naturally choose?** 

- From the technical perspective, the cloud resource selection is based on the combination of functional and non-functional requirements. However, we can still meet this requirements on an on-demand basis 

- Remember that previous infrastructure models where design to choose resource for "Peak times" rather than usage-based consumption. This might trigger the selection of suboptimal resources for an application 



Which will deliver more success to the business? 

By detaching ourselves from the non-functional (i.e., technical) aspects of the solution, we will realize that cloud resources can meet the business requirements at the same level (i.e., right-sizing instead of oversizing) 


This is also a direct feedback loop to development and operations teams on how a specific business functionality should be designed and deployed. By adoption modern frameworks such as DevOps, Agile and Continuous delivery we can make the cloud economies of scale work in favour of our optimization efforts and not the opposite 



Which one will make managers and finance want do more things in the cloud? 

As financial metrics, such as Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Return of Investment (ROI), are continuously ensuring the best business case for Cloud, the business and finance teams will feel encouraged to move more systems in to the cloud platform. Leverage this opportunity to expand your cloud scope.  


It is important for all teams to understand how their cloud resource decisions can completely overshadow the business benefits of cloud and discouraging adoption from the business. A healthy balance of policy, cost and optimization management will help address this challenge
