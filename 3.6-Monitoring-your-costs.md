# Monitoring your Costs 

Monitoring your usage and spending is critically important for cloud infrastructures because organizations pay for the resources they consume over time. When usage exceeds agreement thresholds, unexpected cost overages can quickly occur. 

Azure Cost Management (which is licensed by Cloudyn, a Microsoft subsidiary)  can help you track cloud usage and expenditures for your Azure resources so that you can:
  
  - [Track trends](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management/tutorial-review-usage#track-usage-and-cost-trends): You track actual money spent for usage and costs with Over Time reports to identify trends.
  - [Detect Inefficiencies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management/tutorial-review-usage#track-usage-and-cost-trends): by creating optimizer reports that improve efficiency, optimize usage, and identify ways to save money spent on your cloud resources. 
  - [Create Alerts for Unusual Spending](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management/tutorial-review-usage#create-alerts-for-unusual-spending): to alert stakeholders automatically for spending anomalies and overspending risks
  - Create and use easy-to-understand [dashboard reports](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management/dashboards) to help with cost allocation, [showbacks and chargebacks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management/tutorial-manage-costs#create-showback-and-chargeback-reports). 

Here is an example of a cost over time report:

## Guidance
Use the information as follows to help monitor your costs.  
  - Implement [Resource Tags](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-getting-started#tags) to group your billing data
  
  - [Set up Billing Alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-set-up-alerts) to create customized billing alerts that help you monitor and manage billing activity for your Azure accounts. This will ensure stakeholders are automatically alerted of their usage costs and spending anomalies.
  - If your organization has a reporting system that you prefer to use, leverage [Azure billing APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-usage-rate-card-overview) to help understand your usage and consumption.
  - [Regularly check the portal for cost breakdown and burn rate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-getting-started#costs) to understand the current spend rate of your Azure resources
  - [Understand cost management reports](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management/understanding-cost-reports)
  - Set up [budgets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management/manage-budgets#create-budgets) and [budget-based alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management/manage-budgets#create-budget-alerts-for-a-filter) to help to improve your cloud governance model and ensure that your lines of business stakeholers are accountable for their subscription costs
  - [Turn on Azure Advisor recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-getting-started#turn-on-and-check-out-azure-advisor-recommendations) to help you reduce costs by identifying resources with low usage
  - [Assign access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management/tutorial-user-access) to lines of business stakeholders so that they can have visibility on their cost management data.
  - Implement future [forecast spending]9https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management/tutorial-forecast-spending) to help you forecast your costs using historical usage and spending data.
